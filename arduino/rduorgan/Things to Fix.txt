MCP pin 1 FET doesn't work.  Need to replace it or nix Aux1 and shift smoke valve function to that pin.

Heater duty cycle not fully enforced if smoke generator repeatedly stopped & started.

Valve 13 was being intermittent - the problem is in the valve block, not my h/w or s/w, but should still be looked at.

---- Fixed 6/10/15 ----

playSpeaker() setting frequency incorrectly.

---- Fixed 5/8/15 ----


Make default servo mapping 1000 - 2000


---- Fixed 5/5/15 ----


Serial and servos fight w/each other on smoke & bell (servo in neutral position immediately cancels serial cmd)

Occasional spurious smoke & bell servo cmds when transmitter off
